# Smart-Shopping-App---ReactJS

**Live At - https://smartshoppingapp.netlify.app/**

• Developed a **fully functional** e-commerce **shopping cart application** using **React** with **Redux Toolkit** for scalable **state management** and **React Router** for multi-page navigation.

• Designed a dynamic **Home page** displaying **product listings** with **search filtering**, integrated **cart summary**, and interactive “**Add to Cart**” and “**Remove from Cart**” actions.

• Built a **Product Details page** with detailed **product info**, conditionally rendering cart actions based on current **cart state**.

• Implemented a **Cart page** enabling users to manage **cart items**, adjust **quantities**, remove products, and view real-time updates of **total items** and **pricing**.

• Integrated a **Checkout flow** with a **confirmation screen** and seamless navigation back to the **home page** for continued shopping.

• Utilized **Context API** to manage global **user profile data** and personalized the UI with user information across multiple pages.

• Employed **React Hooks** including **useState**, **useEffect**, **useContext**, **useSelector**, and **useDispatch** to handle **state**, **effects**, and **Redux interactions**.

• Achieved smooth **conditional rendering**, ensuring a **user-friendly experience** with contextual UI updates (e.g., disabling checkout if the cart is empty).

• Organized the codebase with **modular components**, maintaining clean and **maintainable project structure**.
